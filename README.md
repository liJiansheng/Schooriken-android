## App Overview
This app was developed for Singapore Schools in 2014. I was working as a teacher then and there were many tasks a teacher and schools have to fufil. Teachers and students are in different groups and there were many updates from different groups that need to be desseminated quickly. Parents need to be informed about different updates as well.

## How it works
This app has a web app and android app as well. Teachers will use the web app to update students on 3 main categories. They can add Events, Homework and Announcements. They can target specific students groups like classes or interest groups to receive the updates.

Students and parents receive updates on their mobile apps. All 3 categories will appear differently on the mobile apps for students and parents. 

Students and parents must choose their classes and groups they belong to in the app to receive the correct information. Parents can see the same updates as their child.

### Events
Students can see the events on the app and they can choose to join the specific event if required. Teachers will recieve their details on the webapp when they join. This feature was created because sometimes teachers organised events and require different students to fill up their details. 

This is usually a long process involving teachers giving out forms and chasing students to return them. Via the app, they can receive details of interested students immediately. When a student joins, the event becomes a reminder post.

### Homework
Students will see work posts as reminders. Students can see number of days to due date for the work. They can mark the work as complete to remove the reminders.

### Announcements
These are just posts on different announcements. Announcements can be school wide or just class specific.

## On Boarding Process
Schools will submit teachers, students and parents accounts in an excel file in a fixed format. The file will be uploaded and accounts generated in a batch. Students accounts will be verified via email.
